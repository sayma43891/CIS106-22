## Concepts I do not understand:

* Web Server: the web server is typically equipped with a software firewall


## What is a web server? Hardware and software side
The term web server can refer to hardware or software, or both of them working together.
On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files). 
On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files.

## What are some different web server applications?
To publish a website, you need either a static or a dynamic web server.

A static web server, or stack, consists of a computer (hardware) with an HTTP server (software). We call it "static" because the server sends its hosted files as-is to your browser.

A dynamic web server consists of a static web server plus extra software, most commonly an application server and a database. We call it "dynamic" because the application server updates the hosted files before sending content to your browser via the HTTP server.
